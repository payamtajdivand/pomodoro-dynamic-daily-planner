# 🍅 Dynamic Pomodoro Day Planner

Some people struggle to stick to a static daily plan — life doesn't always start at 9 AM. Whether you wake up at 8, 13, or even 18, this planner adapts your entire day around your actual wake-up time, so you never have to feel "behind schedule" again.

## What it does

Enter your wake-up time, pick how many Pomodoros you want, and get a full dynamic daily schedule — including deep work blocks, short & long breaks, meals, wind-down time, and a calculated sleep time.

## Features

- ⏰ Adapts to any wake-up time
- 🍅 12 Pomodoros by default (8 / 10 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 options)
- ⏱ Classic 25min or Extended 50min sessions
- 🧩 Work types: Coding, Study, Work/Admin, or Mixed
- 🌙 Auto-calculates your sleep time
